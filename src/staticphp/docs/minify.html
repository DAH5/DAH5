<p>When websites are being developed, we tend to like our files to be easy to read. So we insert plenty of spacing, indentation and blank lines. This is all very good for the development process, but once the site has been deployed to a server, this extra "comfort" requires more bandwidth to download to the visitor's device, which also comes with extra time required to complete the process.</p>
<p>StaticPHP's Minify feature is here to help!</p>
<p>Once enabled, it will remove all the extra comfort spacing during the build process, making the output files smaller for deployment and faster delivery to the visitor. The source files will remain with the extra spacing in place, so development remains comfortable.</p>
<p>Visit the <a href="/staticphp/docs/getting-started">Getting Started</a> page to see how this feature can be enabled for use for your next project build process.</p>
